# Deucalion

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leotindall/deucalion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/team-code/deucalion)

## What?
Deucalion is a game engine designed to bridge the gap between restrictive engine/IDE combinations like RPG Maker MV and fully custom engines. 

# How?
Games for Deucalion are scripted in Lua, a simple but powerful programming language that allows developers whose strengths are in writing or game art rather than programming to use the engine while not preventing those with more programming experience or very specialized requirements to specify advanced behavior.

Deucalion natively supports the Tiled map editor's TMX map format, allowing arbitrarily large and complex maps to be designed using all available features of this mature, well-supported map editor.
