# Organization
This file is a place to document the structure of the deucalion-rs code.

## Basic Structure
This project follows the normal cargo structure.

## Module Structure
* `utility` contains general-purpose utility datatypes that are likely to be
  used by many other modules. Dependencies there should be minimal.
