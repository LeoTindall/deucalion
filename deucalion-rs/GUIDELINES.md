# Guidelines

## What is this document?
This is a set of guidelines for the deucalion-rs project. Any deviation from
these guidelines should be explained in comments.

## Datatypes
### Integers
Signed and unsigned integers should be `i32` or `u32`, respectively, except
when they are meant to be passed to API functions that require specific
types. In those cases, the reason for the deviation should be documented.

When integers are being used as dimensions, they need to be wrapped in the
appropriate Euclid types, which associate them with either `ScreenSpace`
or `WorldSpace`. This allows the typechecker to statically prevent confusing
screen points with world points.

### Errors
`error.rs` defines DeucalionError. When a function might encounter an error, it
should return a Result<T, DeucalionError>. If DeucalionError doesn't have the
type of error available, you should implement it or use OtherError
(by `DeucalionError::from("string literal")` or `DeucalionError::from(string)`).

## Logging Practices
deucalion-rs uses the Rust `log` logging abstraction. The macros `error!()`,
`warning!()`, etc should be used to log messages.
### Logging Levels
* The _error_ logging level is for information the player needs to be aware of -
  for example, why the game crashed, or why a certain savefile can't be opened.
* The _warning_ logging level is for information the developer of a game using
  the engine needs to be aware of - for example, why a Lua script can't be run,
  or that an Info whose value is `nil` has been retrieved.
* The _info_ logging level is for information that a game developer needs in
  order to effectively debug their game - for example, that a map or resource
  was loaded, or that a Lua script was executed.
* The _debug_ logging level is for information about the internal operation
  of the engine that no game developer needs - it is for engine development
  and debugging only. For example, the debug log might include
  messages on every registered keypress.
* The _trace_ logging level is for extremely detailed information about the
  internal operation of the engine: for example, "Drew a tile at {x},{y}",
  or "Drew sprite {name}". This is generally useful only for
  debugging thorny engine logic issues, and therefore is allowed to do
  expensive computations.
